/**
 * Product events: the things a feature's goal counts, for the SDLC tool's outcome loop.
 *
 * The feature's PRD names them (its Instrumentation section) and the HLD says which repo records
 * each. When it's this app, track them where they happen:
 *
 *   import { track } from "./events";
 *   track("checkin_completed");
 *
 * The count rides in the minute's post to the BFF (cohorts.ts): on each side of every flag in use,
 * so a gradual release can compare how often people with a feature on do it against people with it
 * off, and in total, which the BFF logs as `valxel.events {"checkin_completed":12}` for the tool's
 * staging check and counts on its `valxel.events` meter.
 *
 * Only the name and how many times leave the browser: no attributes, pages or anything about the
 * person. A name that isn't lowercase words joined by _ or . is a mistake in the code: it throws
 * in development and tests, and is dropped in production rather than break the page.
